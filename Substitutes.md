<h1>Ingredients Substitutes</h1>

If you are allergic to some of the ingredients, follow a specific diet (e.g. vegan) or just want to bake a healthier version of your cake, have a look at some general guidelines for ingredients substitutes.


FLOUR – the usual standard flour is all-purpose flour, self-rising flour, wheat flour. 

If you are vegan you can also try: chickpea flour, almond flour, gluten-free mixture, coconut flour (besan), rise flour, buckwheat flour, quinoa flour, oat flour, millet flour or yellow pea flour.

MILK – there are PLENTY types of milk so depending on your dietary preferences there’s: cow milk, soya milk, oat milk, plant milk, canned coconut milk.

If you don’t drink milk at all, you can use yoghurt (natural, Greek), buttercream, sour cream.

SUGAR – you can use granulated white or brown sugar, caster sugar, coconut sugar or for a healthier version: xylitol and sweeteners (e.g. Stevia).

Another option is using honey, maple syrup or other syrup flavours or your choice. Mind the ratio here, though, cause it affects the level of sweetness.


EGGS – you can replace eggs with vinegar and baking soda, plain or vanilla soya yoghurt, unsweetened apple sauce, silken tofu, ripe banana, ground flaxseed.

Each egg substitute works best for a different type of cake and you can read about it on this page: [Egg Substitutes](https://www.pccmarkets.com/taste/2013-03/egg_substitutes/) 


FAT – butter, lard, olive oil, coconut oil, vegetable shortening – they are essential in baking as they affect the richness, flavour, moisture and tenderness of the cake.
