<h1>Other Tools</h1>


**Bakeboard** 

When you bake you'll probably form the dough on the bakeboard. This will work best for the shortcrust pie or biscuits. If you don’t have one, you can also do the same on the kitchen counter. Make sure you clean it first so there's no dust or breadcrumbs in your pie!


**Rolling pin** 

Most probably you have one wooden rolling pin at home. If not, or you’re on holidays, but still want to bake something, you can always use a plastic bottle of water or a bottle of wine. Just remove the label and wash the bottle as it'll have contact with food.


**A teaspoon and a table spoon**

They're often used to measure the ingredients properly, especially when you don't owe a kitchen scale. Many recipes still use this way of measuring ingredients.

**A wooden / silicone spatula**

Whichever tool you use to mix your ingredients it would be fine. However, wood and silicone prevent your pots and the muffin pan from scratching when you operate with the dough or melt in butter with cocoa.

**Baking paper**

When you bake something you'll most probably use a baking pan, tin or an oven tray. Regardless of your choice, before you put anything inside, you should put in baking paper first. It'll prevent your cake from sticking into the surface or even burn. 

If you’re using silicone forms, then the baking paper isn’t necessary. 
If you don’t want to use baking paper, you can also grease the baking tin with oil or butter and it should prevent the cake from sticking too.

**Cling film**

Cling film is useful if you work with a sticky type of dough. You can use it on the bakeboard or wrap it around the rolling pin. Another option is to sprinkle flour on the bakeboard or the rolling pin, but you must be careful because using too much flour can make the dough too dry or too tough. 


**A toothpick or a paring knife**

It may sound funny, but these simple tools will allow you to check if your cake is fully baked. It may happen that the cake changes the colour into brown and looks ready from the outside but inside it's still raw. Hence, you'll need a toothpick or a knife to insert inside the cake. If it comes out dry, the cake is baked. If you can see some bits of raw dough on it, then it means the cake needs a few more minutes in the oven. Just wait and use the clean knife or toothpick again to check the cake.
