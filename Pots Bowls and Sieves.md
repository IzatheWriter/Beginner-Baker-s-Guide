<h1>Pots Bowls and Sieves</h1>

**Saucepan**

Sometimes the recipe will ask you to melt the butter, honey, cream or heat milk. The best and the most convenient way is to use a saucepan or a small pot of your choice.

**Sieve**

A sieve is an optional tool. You can skip it if you want to. However, when you sift flour, powdered sugar and other dry ingredients, it will make the cake lighter and you will avoid flour lumps in your batter.

**Tall bowls**


You will need two or more bowls for your baking. Oftentimes you will need to mix your ingredients separately so one bowl would go for your dry ingredients and the other for the wet ones. Make sure the bowls are tall so the ingredients don't sputter all over the kitchen and yourself! You can also use a pot or any other tall container.
