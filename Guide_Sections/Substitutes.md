<h1>Ingredients Substitutes</h1>

If you're allergic to some of the ingredients, follow a specific diet (e.g. vegan) or just want to bake a healthier version of your cake, have a look at some general guidelines for ingredients substitutes.


**FLOUR** – the usual standard flour is all-purpose flour, self-rising flour, wheat flour. 

If you are vegan, you can also try: 

- Chickpea flour
- Almond flour 
- Gluten-free mixture 
- Coconut flour (besan)
- Rice flour
- Buckwheat flour
- Quinoa flour 
- Oat flour 
- Millet flour
- Yellow pea flour

**MILK** – there are plenty of types of milk so depending on your dietary preferences there are:

- Cow milk
- Soya milk
- Oat milk 
- Plant milk
- Canned coconut milk

If you don’t drink milk at all, you can use:

- Yoghurt (natural, Greek)
- Buttercream
- Sour cream

You can read about how much of each replaced product you should use in your recipe: [Milk Substitutes for Baking](https://www.delish.com/cooking/a38422869/whole-milk-substitutes-for-baking/) 

**SUGAR** – you can use:

- Granulated white or brown sugar
- Caster sugar 
- Coconut sugar
- For a healthier version: xylitol and sweeteners (e.g. Stevia)

Another option (instead of sugar) is using:

- Honey
- Maple syrup or other syrup flavours of your choice

Mind the ratio here, though, as it affects the level of sweetness.


**EGGS** – you can replace eggs with:

- Vinegar and baking soda
- Plain or vanilla soya yoghurt 
- Unsweetened apple sauce
- Silken tofu
- Ripe banana
- Ground flaxseed

Each egg substitute works best for a different type of cake and you can read about it on this page: [Egg Substitutes](https://www.pccmarkets.com/taste/2013-03/egg_substitutes/) 


**FAT** – it's essential in baking in that it affects the richness, flavour, moisture and tenderness of the cake. You shouldn't skip it. It's also not always possible to replace some types of fat. If you bake butter biscuits, there's no way to make them using e.g. olive oil instead.

You can use the following fat options in your recipe:

- Butter
- Lard
- Olive oil
- Coconut oil
- Vegetable shortening
