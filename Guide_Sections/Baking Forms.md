<h1>Baking forms</h1>

**A muffin pan**

There are many types of muffin pans in the market.  I personally recommend the one with silicone muffin holders. The dough doesn't stick to the pan, and the holders keep the muffin stable in the oven. It's also easy to clean.

You can purchase the above set here: [AliExpress Silicone Muffin Cups](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005986393187.htm).


There are also full silicone muffin holders. They're wobbly, though, so make sure to place them on the baking tray before you put the dough inside (as shown in the image below).

**A baking form – light not dark**

It's best to use ligth colour baking forms rather than the dark. Dark colours conduct more heat which can make your baked goods bake much faster than you want. It’s often better to use the light coloured ones.
